In the morning, men and women run to the park and jump on the bank near the long green bench. A small drum makes a strong thump, and children hum and sing as they climb and swing. Someone brings milk in a can and sets it among the cups. The sun sinks low, and the wind runs along the path, linking one moment to the next.
