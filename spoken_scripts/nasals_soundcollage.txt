Mumbling monks meandered among mangled monuments, clinking anklets and clanking tumbled trunks, mingling mantra with murmur, naming none, meaning much. In the dimming gloom, an unending minglement of ringing, drumming, thunking, sinking tones unspooled, linking moment to monument, monument to omen, omen to unknown. Lanterns, long-burnt, blinked and sank, swinging, swinging, then stilled, as an unnumbered throng of winged things thrummed in trembling unison. Monstrous, magnificent, unmooring â€” the mingled clangor rang, rank and resounding, until nothing remained but the hum, the murmur, the unending unknowing.
