Amid the waning gloaming, mendicants convened beneath the ramshackle cloister, intoning litanies that commingled with the muffled clunking of iron-bound reliquaries. An enshrined censer, rimmed with verdigris enamel, swung languorously, emanating an unctuous mingling of myrrh and camphor. Monuments of obsidian and pumice, half sunken in the loam, anchored the sanctum in a somnolent stillness, while an unnumbered throng of winged seraphim descended, their chanting resounding against the crumbling embankments. The ambiance, trembling and unending, interlinked omen, monument, and incantation, until the encroaching night extinguished every lingering glimmer of dominion.
