At dawn the pilgrims meandered beneath the crumbling colonnade, murmuring incantations that mingled with the resonant clanking of ancient chains. A monk in a crimson mantle arranged an enamelled lamp among the monuments, its dim flame sinking into the encroaching mist. Somewhere beyond the ramparts, a solemn hymn rang, its lingering cadence entwining with the melancholy wind. The ambience, trembling and uncommon, summoned a kind of uncanny stillness, linking memory to omen in unending measure.
