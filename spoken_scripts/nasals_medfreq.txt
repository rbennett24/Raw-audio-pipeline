By noon the children wander toward the narrow bridge and gather around the fountain, humming simple tunes while a drummer taps a pattern on a worn plank. A woman carries a basket of lemons and places them among the blankets spread on the ground. Birds clank against the metal railing, wings brushing the air as the crowd lingers. The sky darkens, and lanterns blink along the walkway, marking the change from daylight to evening calm.
